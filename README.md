# PARTY PAGE

This is a party invitation webpage. It was created as a test and portfolio version of a page I will make for my husband's upcoming birthday party. It was also a way to practise using Sanity. Sanity allows for a user to add content such as images and text, without having to actually build a webpage themselves.

## Technologies

This project was created with React (starting with Create React App). The navigation is powered by React Router DOM, the map by Pigeon Maps and the content is edited in, stored in and fetched from Sanity, which is a headless CMS. A custom hook was created to validate form input (courtesy of CodeBucks https://dev.to/codebucks/form-validation-in-reactjs-by-building-reusable-custom-hook-1bg7). 

## About the sign-up form
The sign-up form contains some validation, however the response is not sent anywhere... The real web page might need to have the sign-up form protected by password or at least the whole web page should not be known outside of the group of people actually being invited. The sign-up in the "real" version could be an embedded Google form, or it could be the custom form connected to a database, or even Sanity.
